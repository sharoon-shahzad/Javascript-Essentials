What you will learn
In this lab, you will explore how JavaScript dynamically generates restaurant menu sections for breakfast, main course, and dessert using JavaScript's array methods. You will learn to use map to populate the breakfast menu, forEach to display the main course menu items, and a traditional for loop to render the dessert items. Additionally, you will understand how HTML content can be updated dynamically, showcasing the power of JavaScript in modifying webpage elements based on predefined arrays.

Learning objectives
After completing this lab, you will be able to:

Understanding DOM manipulation: Gain proficiency in accessing HTML elements and dynamically updating their content using JavaScript. Focus on the getElementById method to precisely alter specific elements within a webpage.

Array iteration methods: Differentiate between various array iteration methods like map, forEach, and for loops. Observe their distinct functionalities in iterating through arrays and generating structured HTML content.

Dynamic web content creation: Learn the process of dynamically generating and rendering content on a webpage by using JavaScript to create structured menus based on predefined arrays, emphasizing the dynamic nature of web development.

Menu section organization: Grasp the concept of organizing webpage content into sections (e.g., breakfast, main course, dessert) by populating HTML elements with data from corresponding JavaScript arrays, facilitating structured and readable webpage layouts.

Application of JavaScript methods: Apply JavaScript methods (map, forEach, getElementById, innerHTML) to manipulate HTML file effectively, showcasing the practical usage of these methods in generating and updating webpage content dynamically based on predefined data.
